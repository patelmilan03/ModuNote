# ModuNote — Complete Device Testing Guide
> **Covers Phases 1–8** (all shipped code as of Phase 8 Categories completion).
> Every check is a pass/fail statement. Run on a **physical Android device**.
> 🔴 = must pass before any commit. ⚠️ STUB = intentional placeholder for a future phase.

---

## Pre-Test Setup

Run these commands every time before starting a test session:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter analyze        # must report: No issues found!
flutter run            # connect physical Android device first
```

**Device state required:**
- USB debugging on, device trusted
- App freshly installed **or** existing install's DB wiped (`adb shell pm clear com.modunote.app`) for first-launch checks
- Device language: English
- Microphone permission **not yet granted** for permission-flow sections (use a fresh install or revoke in Settings → Apps → ModuNote → Permissions)
- Both light and dark OS themes available for theme checks

## Section 33 — Category Picker: Sheet UI (Phase 8)

> Access by opening any note in the editor then tapping the **category chip** in the tag row.

### 33A — Sheet Open

| # | Check | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| 33.1 🔴 | Tapping category chip → `MNCategoryPickerSheet` slides up | Bottom sheet opens; no crash |
| 33.2 | Sheet has a grabber (36×4 dp, `outlineStrong` colour, border-radius 2) | Visible at top of sheet |
| 33.3 | Sheet corner radius: 28 dp top-left and top-right | Rounded top corners |
| 33.4 | Sheet header reads `"Move to category"` (PJS 19/800/−0.3) | Bold heading visible |
| 33.5 | Header subtitle reads `"Organise this note in your folder tree"` (Inter 12.5/400/muted) | Smaller muted text |
| 33.6 | Close × button: 34×34 circle, `surfaceContainer` bg, 18 dp icon | Top-right of header |
| 33.7 | Tapping × → sheet dismisses, no category change | Null result; note unchanged |
| 33.8 | Swiping sheet down → sheet dismisses, no category change | Same null result |

### 33B — "None" Row

| # | Check | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| 33.9 🔴 | "None" row is the first item in the list | Above all category rows |
| 33.10 | "None" row has `folder_off_outlined` icon | Folder-with-x icon |
| 33.11 | Tapping "None" → sheet closes | Returns `""` (empty string = unassign) |
| 33.12 🔴 | After tapping "None": category chip in editor shows default/unassigned state | `categoryName == null` |
| 33.13 | When note has no category assigned: "None" row shows a checkmark `✓` | Pre-selected state |
| 33.14 | When note has a category assigned: "None" row has no checkmark | Unselected |

### 33C — Category Tree Rows

| # | Check | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| 33.15 🔴 | Root-level categories appear with no indentation (or base 10 dp left padding) | Not indented |
| 33.16 🔴 | Child categories indented by `10 + depth × 20` dp from left | e.g. depth 1 = 30 dp, depth 2 = 50 dp |
| 33.17 | Category with children shows expand chevron (right-pointing) | `keyboard_arrow_right` icon visible |
| 33.18 | Category without children shows no chevron (spacer instead) | No icon; row still aligns |
| 33.19 🔴 | Tapping expand chevron → children appear below parent | Tree expands inline |
| 33.20 | Tapping chevron again → children collapse | Tree collapses |
| 33.21 | Tapping chevron does NOT select the category | Only the row tap selects |
| 33.22 | Tapping a category row → sheet closes | Returns that category's id |
| 33.23 🔴 | After tapping a category: category chip in editor shows that category's name | `categoryName == category.name` |
| 33.24 | Selected row: `primaryContainer` background + check ✓ icon + bold name + `folder` (filled) icon | Highlighted selection |
| 33.25 | Unselected rows: transparent background + `folder_outlined` icon | Normal appearance |
| 33.26 | When opening sheet for a note with an assigned category: that category row shows checkmark | Pre-selected |
| 33.27 | When opening sheet for a note with an assigned category AND it's nested: ancestor rows are pre-expanded | Selection visible without manual expansion |

### 33D — "New Category" Row

| # | Check | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| 33.28 🔴 | "New category" row is last in the list | Below all category rows |

| 33.31 | When a category is selected in the tree: row shows `"Under · <name>"` hint text | Context hint visible on right |
| 33.32 | When no category is selected: no hint text shown | Right side empty |
| 33.33 🔴 | Tapping "New category" → AlertDialog opens with text field | "New category" dialog title |
| 33.34 | Dialog hint text shows parent context: `"Name (under <parent>)"` if a category is selected; `"Name (at root)"` otherwise | Contextual placeholder |
| 33.35 🔴 | Submitting a name → new category created, tree updates | Category appears in tree |
| 33.36 | New category created under the currently-selected parent (if one is selected) | Adjacency-list parent set correctly |
| 33.37 | New category created at root if no category is selected (or "None" is selected) | `parentId = null` |
| 33.38 | Submitting empty name → dialog closes, nothing created | Graceful no-op |
| 33.39 | Tapping Cancel in dialog → no category created | Cancel works |

### 33E — Sheet Scrolling & Constraints

| # | Check | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| 33.40 | Sheet content area is scrollable when tree has many categories | `ListView` scrolls within `ConstrainedBox(maxHeight: 55% of screen)` |
| 33.41 | Sheet does not exceed 55% of screen height | Content clips cleanly |
| 33.42 | Keyboard safe area respected at bottom | Content not hidden by nav gestures |

---

## Section 34 — Category Picker: Assignment & Persistence (Phase 8)

| # | Check | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| 34.1 🔴 | Assign a category to a note via picker → force-kill app, relaunch, open note → category chip still shows assigned category | `categoryId` committed to `notes` table |
| 34.2 🔴 | Unassign a category ("None") → force-kill, relaunch → category chip shows default | `categoryId = null` persisted |
| 34.3 | Assign category A, then re-open picker and assign category B → note shows B | Category replaced, not appended |
| 34.4 | Note List screen: note card shows no category indication until Phase 9 decides card layout | No card regression |

---

## Section 35 — Category Deletion: Re-Parent Policy (Phase 8)

> Create a small tree to test: Root → A → B (B is child of A). Add notes assigned to A.

| # | Check | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| 35.1 🔴 | Delete category A (which has child B and assigned notes) — child B should now be at root | B appears with no parent (root level) |
| 35.2 🔴 | Notes previously assigned to A → after delete, `categoryId = null` | Notes become Uncategorised |
| 35.3 | Category B's sub-children (if any at depth 2) stay as children of B after A is deleted | Only direct children re-parented; deeper descendants unaffected |
| 35.4 | Force-kill app after deletion, relaunch → re-parent state persisted | DB committed before kill |

### 35A — DB Verification for Category Operations

```sql
-- In DB Browser Execute SQL tab
SELECT id, name, parent_id, sort_order FROM categories ORDER BY parent_id NULLS FIRST, name;
```

| # | Check | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| 35.5 🔴 | After assigning a category to a note: `categories` row exists; `notes.category_id` matches | FK valid |
| 35.6 | After unassigning: `notes.category_id` is NULL | Column nulled |
| 35.7 | After deleting A (which had child B): A row absent; B row has `parent_id = NULL` (was A's parent) | Re-parent committed |
| 35.8 | Notes that had `category_id = A.id` now have `category_id = NULL` | `clearCategoryFromNotes` ran |

## Section 33 — `flutter analyze` Gate

| # | Check | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| 33.1 🔴 | `flutter analyze` returns **`No issues found!`** | Zero errors, zero warnings, zero infos |

Run this before every commit. Do not commit if any issues are reported.

| Note editor `⋮` overflow does nothing | Future |
| Bottom nav active-tab highlight is hardcoded per screen | Phase 9 (GoRouter ShellRoute) |
| Theme preference resets on app restart | Phase 9 (SharedPreferences) |
| `SyncStatus` on notes is always `"local"` | Phase 10 |
