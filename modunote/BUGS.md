# ModuNote — Known Bugs (permanent record)

> Canonical, permanent ledger of open bugs. Source of truth for bug detail — `STATUS.md` and any GitHub issues point here, not the reverse.
>
> **Origin:** 2026-07-18 four-agent read-only audit (models ↔ viewmodels ↔ views ↔ services). **16 bugs, 0 blockers.** ALL are **pre-existing** — none introduced by the 2026-07-18 screen-split refactor (the refactored widget code was audited clean). Severities are the post-verification calibration (two agent "HIGH"s downgraded because they degrade gracefully).
>
> **Recommended fix order:** #1 → #3 → #4 → #2 → #6/#7 → then #5, #8–#16.
> Each fix: `flutter analyze` = 0 → `flutter test` green → read-only Dart verification subagent → mark done here (strike through / move to a "Fixed" section).
>
> To file these as GitHub issues later, ask Claude to regenerate a `gh issue create` script from this file (one issue per bug, severity + area labels).

## MED-HIGH

### 1. Audio session leaked on nearly every note view
- **Where:** `lib/presentation/views/note_editor/widgets/voice_panel.dart:56` + `lib/presentation/views/note_editor/note_editor_screen.dart:99` · area: audio, editor
- **Problem:** `VoicePanel.initState` calls `widget.audioService.init()` (opens the native FlutterSound recorder+player), but the screen's `dispose()` closes the service only when `_audioInitialized` is true — and that flag is set **only** inside `_onMicTap`. `VoicePanel` never sets it.
- **Failure:** Open an existing note (VoicePanel renders when the keyboard is down), view/play, leave **without recording** → `dispose()` skips `_audioService.dispose()`. Native session leaks on essentially every note view; repeated opens can exhaust sessions ("recorder busy").
- **Fix:** `AudioRecordingService.dispose()` is idempotent — drop the `if (_audioInitialized)` guard and always `await _audioService.dispose()`. (Or set `_audioInitialized = true` when the panel initialises the shared service.)

## MEDIUM

### 2. Deleting a tag orphans note_tags rows + stale note.tagIds
- **Where:** `lib/data/datasources/local/daos/tags_dao.dart:69` (via `local_tag_repository.dart:117`) · area: data
- **Problem:** `deleteTag(id)` deletes only the `tags` row — not the `note_tags` join rows, and it doesn't refresh the denormalised `note.tagIds` JSON. No FK / `ON DELETE CASCADE`; `foreign_keys` PRAGMA off. Contract (`i_tag_repository.dart`) says delete "removes all its note associations."
- **Failure:** Delete a tag still attached to notes → tag row gone, but `tagIds` + `note_tags` rows linger forever. `findById` returns null while `watchByTag`/`countNotesPerTag` still see the notes. Re-creating the tag mints a new UUID → dangling rows never reconnect. (UI degrades gracefully — unresolved ids are dropped from display.)
- **Fix:** In `TagsDao.deleteTag`, transaction: delete `note_tags WHERE tag_id = id`, re-sync `tagIds` for affected notes, then delete the tag row. **Design choice to confirm:** transactional cascade (matches codebase style) vs enabling SQLite FK cascade (bigger schema change, still needs the `tagIds` refresh) — recommend transactional.

### 3. NoteEditorViewModel.save() drops note value during write → concurrent edit lost
- **Where:** `lib/presentation/viewmodels/note_editor_view_model.dart:23` · area: viewmodel
- **Problem:** `save()` sets `state = const AsyncLoading();` (bare, no `copyWithPrevious`), so `state.valueOrNull` is `null` for the whole insert/update await window.
- **Failure:** `addTag`/`removeTag`/`setCategory`/`togglePin` each early-return when `state.valueOrNull == null`. If one fires while an autosave is in flight (tap a tag chip as the 800 ms debounce fires) → silent no-op, edit dropped.
- **Fix:** `state = const AsyncLoading<Note?>().copyWithPrevious(state);` or serialise edits against the in-flight save.

### 4. Mutation errors clobber stream-backed list state (whole list vanishes)
- **Where:** `note_list_view_model.dart` (+ `category_tree_view_model.dart`, `archived_notes_view_model.dart`, `audio_editor_view_model.dart`) · area: viewmodel
- **Problem:** Mutation methods on Stream-backed notifiers set `state = AsyncError(e, st)` on failure, replacing the whole streamed list. The failed op made no DB change → no re-emission restores it.
- **Failure:** A failed `togglePin`/`archive`/`delete`/`move` makes the entire list vanish into a full-screen error until an unrelated DB change fires.
- **Fix:** Surface mutation errors via return value / toast (as `TagListViewModel.insert` rethrows), leaving list state intact.

### 5. Home long-press actions sheet occluded by floating nav (missing useRootNavigator)
- **Where:** `lib/presentation/views/note_list/widgets/swipeable_note_card.dart:26` (`_showActionsSheet`) · area: view
- **Problem:** `showModalBottomSheet` omits `useRootNavigator: true`. On Home (ShellRoute nested navigator) the floating `BottomBar`/FAB is drawn outside that navigator, so the sheet is occluded. Sibling account sheet + RAG picker set it; this one was missed.
- **Failure:** Long-press a Home note → the sheet's bottom rows sit under the nav pill/FAB, partly unreachable. (Fine on the full-screen Archive route.)
- **Fix:** Add `useRootNavigator: true`.

### 6. setState after await without mounted guard in _onMicTap / _stopRecording
- **Where:** `note_editor_screen.dart` — `_onMicTap` (~:509-519), `_stopRecording` (~:537-545) · area: editor
- **Problem:** `setState` (and in `_onMicTap` the new `_amplitudeSubscription` + `_recordTimer`) run after multi-`await` chains with no `mounted` guard — inconsistent with the guarded `setState` later in `_stopRecording`.
- **Failure:** System-back during mic start/stop await → `setState` on an unmounted state ("setState after dispose"); a fresh amplitude subscription created post-dispose leaks.
- **Fix:** `if (!mounted) { <cleanup>; return; }` (or `if (mounted) setState(...)`).

### 7. addTag/removeTag/togglePin: no ref.mounted guard + findById null → AsyncData(null)
- **Where:** `note_editor_view_model.dart:57,69,99` · area: viewmodel
- **Problem:** After `await ... .findById(...)`, `state = AsyncData(updated)` runs with no `ref.mounted` check, and `findById` returns `Note?` (may be null).
- **Failure:** (a) Editor popped during await → writing `state` throws `StateError` (masked only by the screen's `catch (_) {}`). (b) A concurrently-deleted note → `findById` null → `state = AsyncData(null)` blanks the VM.
- **Fix:** `if (!ref.mounted) return;` before the write; handle the null result explicitly instead of storing `AsyncData(null)`.

## LOW

### 8. Category max nesting depth off-by-one (caps at 4, docs say 5)
- **Where:** `lib/data/repositories/local/local_category_repository.dart:215-227` (`_assertDepthAllowed`) · area: data · **verified**
- **Problem:** `depth` starts at 1 and the loop also increments for `parentId`, so computed depth = actualParentDepth + 1; the `depth >= 5` guard fires one level early.
- **Failure:** Inserting a legitimate depth-5 node (child under a depth-4 category) throws. Effective usable nesting = 4.
- **Fix:** Start `depth = 0`, or guard on `depth > _maxDepth`. Add a depth-5-chain unit test.

### 9. SyncedNoteRepository.update doesn't set pending → skipped by syncAllPending
- **Where:** `synced_note_repository.dart:52` + `note_editor_view_model.dart:90` · area: data
- **Problem:** `update` delegates to local without setting `syncStatus = pending`; the editor's save preserves the status. Editing a `synced` note leaves it `synced`, so `syncAllPending()` (filters `!= synced`) skips it.
- **Failure:** Edit a synced note, background the app without hitting back (the back path syncs explicitly) → edit never pushed to Firestore.
- **Fix:** `SyncedNoteRepository.update` persists with `syncStatus: pending`.

### 10. FTS search sanitiser misses ' ^ . → invalid MATCH → error instead of empty
- **Where:** `notes_dao.dart:106-110` · area: data
- **Problem:** Strips `" ( ) - + * : ,` but not `'`, `^`, `.`. A query of only those builds an invalid FTS5 MATCH.
- **Failure:** Searching `.` / `^` raises an FTS5 syntax error → re-wrapped as `DatabaseException` → error toast instead of "no results".
- **Fix:** Extend the strip regex (`' ^ .`), or return `[]` on a degenerate token set.

### 11. ViewModel catch clauses only catch AppException → non-AppException escapes
- **Where:** `note_editor_view_model.dart:33,58,70,100` and other VMs · area: viewmodel
- **Problem:** `on AppException` only — a raw `StateError` / un-wrapped platform/Drift/Firestore error escapes as an unhandled async error. Relies on every repo wrapping perfectly.
- **Fix:** Trailing `catch (e, st) { state = AsyncError(e, st); }` (or deliberate rethrow).

### 12. _performAutoSave / _onBack: ref.read after await without mounted guard
- **Where:** `note_editor_screen.dart` — `_performAutoSave` (~:197-206), `_onBack` (~:692-707) · area: editor
- **Problem:** Post-await `ref.read(...)` (state check, `_scheduleRagSync`, `pruneOrphans`) with no `mounted` guard. Reading an auto-dispose provider after dispose re-initialises it; a disposed-ref read can throw `StateError`.
- **Failure:** System-back during a slow `syncNote` await → continuation `ref.read` on a disposed ref.
- **Fix:** `if (!mounted) return;` before the post-await block, or capture providers/services into locals before the await.

### 13. Partial recording start leak: startListening throws after startRecording succeeds
- **Where:** `note_editor_screen.dart:490-512` (`_onMicTap`) · area: audio, editor
- **Problem:** `startListening`/amplitude-subscribe have no try/catch. If `startRecording` succeeds but `startListening` throws, the recorder is left running with no stop path (`_isRecording` never true → no overlay/stop button).
- **Failure:** Recognizer fails after the recorder started → orphaned recording; next mic tap overwrites `_currentRecordingPath` and starts a second recorder → error.
- **Fix:** Wrap `startListening`/subscribe in try/catch that calls `_audioService.stopRecording()` and resets `_currentRecordingPath` on failure.

### 14. AudioRecordingService.onProgress subscription never cancelled
- **Where:** `lib/services/audio/audio_recording_service.dart:71-77` · area: audio
- **Problem:** `_recorder.onProgress!.listen(...)` is never stored/cancelled; a new listener is added on every `startRecording`.
- **Failure:** Record/stop cycles stack up listeners until service dispose (harmless output, growing leak).
- **Fix:** Store the `StreamSubscription`; cancel in `stopRecording` + `dispose`.

### 15. RagIndexTags / audio_pref cold-start load race can clobber user edits
- **Where:** `rag_settings_view_model.dart:20-30` (+ `audio_pref_view_model.dart:14-24`) · area: viewmodel
- **Problem:** `build()` returns the default synchronously and fires `_load()` async, which does an unconditional `state = saved.toSet()`. During the load window the value is the DEFAULT, not persisted; a late `_load` can overwrite an `addTag`/`removeTag` that raced it.
- **Failure:** Practically unreachable (`keepAlive` + ms prefs read vs seconds of user navigation) — latent correctness issue.
- **Fix:** Make the provider `Future<Set<String>>` (async build), or only apply the persisted value while `state` still equals the default.

### 16. Debounce not cancelled before archive → narrow un-archive window
- **Where:** `note_editor_screen.dart` — archive path (~:626-635) · area: editor
- **Problem:** `onArchive` doesn't cancel the pending 800 ms debounce, and `_currentNote` isn't updated to archived. If the timer fires during `await archive(id)` before `context.pop()` (whose dispose cancels it), `_performAutoSave` writes back `isArchived: false` → un-archives.
- **Failure:** Edit then archive within the debounce window, if the archive await outlasts the remaining debounce → note re-appears in the main list. (The delete "resurrect" is NOT reachable — update of a deleted row is a 0-row no-op.)
- **Fix:** `_debounce?.cancel(); _isDirty = false;` at the start of archive; refresh `_currentNote` from VM state after archiving.

### 17. Deleting a note orphans its audio records AND leaks the audio files on disk
- **Where:** `lib/data/datasources/local/daos/notes_dao.dart:158` (`deleteNote`) · `lib/data/datasources/local/tables/audio_records_table.dart` (no FK) · dead cleanup method at `local_audio_record_repository.dart:80` · area: data, audio
- **Found:** 2026-07-18 project-health sweep (dead-code agent surfaced `deleteAllForNote` as unreferenced; verified it is a missing call, not surplus code).
- **Problem:** `deleteNote` deletes only the `notes` row. `audio_records_table` declares **no foreign key / ON DELETE CASCADE**, and nothing calls `deleteAllForNote`. The note-delete path (`note_editor_screen._showDeleteConfirm` → repo delete → RAG deindex → tag `pruneOrphans`) has **no audio cleanup step**, and `AudioFileStorage.deleteFile` is only ever called from the voice panel's per-clip delete.
- **Failure:** Delete a note that has voice recordings → its `audio_records` rows persist forever AND the `.aac` files stay in `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()/audio_notes/`. Unbounded growth (~0.24 MB per recorded minute), invisible to the user, never reclaimed. Worse than the tag-orphan bug (#2) because it leaks real files, not just rows.
- **Fix:** In the note-delete path, call `deleteAllForNote(noteId)` **and** delete each clip's file via `AudioFileStorage.deleteFile` before removing the note (fetch the records first, since the rows are needed to know the paths). Consider also adding the FK + `ON DELETE CASCADE` as a defence-in-depth follow-up (note: DB cascade alone will NOT delete the on-disk files).
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (storage leak, unbounded, silent).
